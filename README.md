## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

The REST API is defined using Swagger and can be viewed at /api/ui endpoint.

Used Cuckoo Filter to check if the name is already present in the system. Cuckoo Filter is a highly space-efficient probabilistic data structure, that is used to check for set membership. It takes about 7 bits per entry with 0% False Negative rate and about 3% False positive rate i.e a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". It can thought of as a tiny, high speed cache which can be used to reduce database reads and thereby increase performance. [More Info](https://bdupras.github.io/filter-tutorial/).

Did not use a database as data persistence was not a key point.
